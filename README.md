ed448.no
```
This domain is protected with DNSSEC algorithm 16 (Ed448). It is hosted at domainname.shop. They sign all their zones using DNSSEC by default.
Ed448 was standardized for use with DNSSEC in February 2017 (RFC8080) and has been a RECOMMENDED algorithm since June 2019 (RFC8624). It has been supported in the .no zone since February 2020. The latest stable versions of OpenSSL (3.x / 1.1.1) fully support Ed448. All older versions (including 1.1.0, 1.0.2 and 1.0.0) are now out of support and users of these older versions are encouraged to upgrade to 3.x or 1.1.1 as soon as possible.
Ed448 is an Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm (EdDSA). Like other ellipctic curve algorithms, its main advantage over RSA is that it offers the same level of security with much shorter key lengths, leading to shorter DNSKEY and RRSIG records. This in turn means that most DNS responses will fit in a single UDP packet (<512 bytes), and the potential for DNS amplification DDoS attacks is greatly reduced. EdDSA also has a number of advantages over ECDSA algorithms such as DNSSEC algorithm 13 (ECDSA P-256) and 14 (ECDSA P-384): it is faster, it is not dependent on a unique random number when generating signatures, it is more resilient to side-channel attacks, and it is easier to implement correctly.

Safeguarding artifact integrity across any software supply chain
Supply-chain Levels for Software Artifacts, or SLSA ("salsa").
It’s a security framework, a checklist of standards and controls to prevent tampering, improve integrity, and secure packages and infrastructure. It’s how you get from "safe enough" to being as resilient as possible, at any link in the chain.

What is a security contact?
A security contact is a way for websites or services to sign post where and how security researchers can get in contact. It also typically describes whether there is any vulnerability disclosure policy or bug bounty.
There are two methods to set security contacts, with a security.txt file served on a known path and with DNS TXT records.
findsecuritycontacts.com scans the top 500 sites daily for their security.txt file or DNS records.
You can also query any website to see if there is a security.txt file (RFC 9116) or DNS records and whether they appear to be formatted correctly.
You can find more about the security.txt file at securitytxt.org or by looking up RFC 9116; and about DNS security records and the status on dnssecuritytxt.org
```
dnssecuritytxt.org
```
DNS Security TXT
A standard allowing organizations to nominate security contact points and policies via DNS TXT records.
This proposal was first made public on March 25, 2021 and is is currently a draft. We welcome comments and feedback! To make suggestions please submit a PR via Github or submit a ticket. Thanks for your interest!

DNSViz is a tool for visualizing the status of a DNS zone. It was designed as a resource for understanding and troubleshooting deployment of the DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC). It provides a visual analysis of the DNSSEC authentication chain for a domain name and its resolution path in the DNS namespace, and it lists configuration errors detected by the tool. Your feedback is appreciated.
